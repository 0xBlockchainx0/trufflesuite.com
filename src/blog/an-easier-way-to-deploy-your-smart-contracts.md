**TL;DR** - Deploying your contracts shouldn't be difficult, and should be flexible. I give a sneak peek at the next feature we're building: an **easy to use interface to deploy your Truffle projects with [Truffle Teams](https://trufflesuite.com/teams)**! It's going to be awesome, and **you can be the first to use it**! I'll be giving a **workshop (9AM-12PM on Friday, 8/2) at [TruffleCon 2019](https://www.trufflesuite.com/trufflecon2019)** which goes through the entire Truffle Teams lifecycle, including the **never-before-used Deployments interface**! See you there!

You've finished implementing your \<insert_correct_capitalization_for_dapp>, you've tested it on [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache), and you're ready to push it to a testnet or mainnet! Congratula—oh wait.

## TODO: IMAGE

It's not that easy.

There are a handful of solutions, and none have _really_ made it painlessly easy. Even our own `truffle migrate` (aka `truffle deploy`) is still sub-optimal.

Well it's about to get a whole lot easier with Truffle Teams.
