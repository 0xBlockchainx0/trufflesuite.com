We're excited to announce that you can now integrate private repositories with Truffle Teams. This will eventually be a premium feature, but we're releasing it for free while the product is still in beta.

## Using Private Repos

Using private repositories with Truffle Teams is simple--you don't have to do anything! Private repos will have a lock icon next to their name indicating their private status. Otherwise, they have the same functionality as public repos.

You'll see that we're very loud about which features will be premium. We'll continue this practice for future premium features and hope to set a good example for transparency in this regard.

## Next Up: Deployments!

We're so glad you're taking the time to follow the development of Truffle Teams--here's a teaser of our next upcoming feature: Visual Deployments.

The visual deployments feature in Truffle Teams shows you, at a glance, which commits have been deployed to staging and live networks. It also provides information on the status of that deployment, when it took place, the contracts acted upon, and more. We've distilled the deployment process into an informative wizard that guides you through the deployment process, mitigating errors and easing the process for those uncomfortable with the console.

We'll release a full article with all the details about using Truffle Teams' deployment features once it's ready for release.

Thank you and happy truffling!
