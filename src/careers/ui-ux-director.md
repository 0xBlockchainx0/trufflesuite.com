_The Truffle suite of tools provides Ethereum developers with easy-to-use solutions for smart contract and decentralized application development. Truffle, a ConsenSys company, enables the growth of Ethereum and open source communities, helps to improve the role of decentralization in society, and empowers developers to achieve their goals._

**About the role:**

Your primary role as a UI/UX Specialist would be to iterate the UI/UX of various Truffle projects in response to user feedback. You'll work with a diverse array of impactful, user-facing code including Drizzle Components, Ganache, and our website. This role is hugely important as it determines user's opinions of us and our products in the most direct sense. Since you'll interact with our development and marketing teams, along with users directly, effective communication skills are a must. The UI/UX Director is responsible for the entire UI/UX process, from feedback to mockups and user testing.

**In the UI/UX Director role, you will be expected to:**

* Gather feedback from users on current (and potential future) front-end designs and experiences.
* Present these findings along with recommendations regarding UI/UX direction.
* Create user stories, UX flow diagrams, wireframes and mockups.
* Present your findings and above deliverables to relevant teams.
* Research and, where effective, implement UX trends.
* Constructively communicate issues to developers and key stakeholders, and advocate for issues that might otherwise go unnoticed or under-prioritized.

**Some things we like to see:**

* A portfolio and/or website containing some of your work.
* Knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator and Draw.io a plus.
* Expertise working on or leading an existing UI/UX team.
* Knowledge of Blockchain user experience specifically, as there are unique challenges and our tools are primarily geared to developers within the Ethereum ecosystem.
* High communication skills via writing, voice and other mediums.
* Creating ways to advocate for issues, including screenshots, screencasts and videos.
* Enthusiasm about Ethereum and blockchain technologies.
* Ability to stay very productive while working remotely.

As we seek to grow Truffle into a more mature product suite and organization, you will be pivotal in achieving our goals both for our user community and for Ethereum development at large. This position is 100% remote and is open to anyone that overlaps with United States timezones. Truffle and ConsenSys are equal opportunity employers and do not discriminate based on race, gender, age, or sexual preference. We welcome all to apply!
