DISH Network Corporation is a U.S. television provider based in Englewood, Colorado. It is the owner of the direct-broadcast satellite provider DISH, also still commonly known as DISH Network, and the over-the-top IPTV service Sling TV. The company has approximately 16,000 employees.

## The Problem

Gartner forecasts blockchain will generate an annual business value of $176 billion by 2025 and rise to over $3.1 trillion by 2030. DISH wanted to upskill their in-house software development teams to explore the potential of this new technological paradigm.

## The Solution

DISH partnered with Truffle Suite to co-develop a long form training program to train DISH’s existing software engineering on blockchain. The program syllabus included the development lifecycle, smart contract development, tokenization, and decentralized identity. Rob Steiner, Head of Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology at Dish says "I’m trying to get our massive team of engineers up to speed. We need to demystify the tech. Truffle does that."
