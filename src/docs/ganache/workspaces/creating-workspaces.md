# Creating Workspaces

The [Quickstart workspace](/docs/ganache/workspaces/the-quickstart-workspace) is great for getting a development blockchain up and running instantly, but for Truffle projects already in progress, or users who need custom configurations, we provide two ways to create a full workspace.

* See [Saving the Current Quickstart Blockchain as a New Workspace](#saving-the-current-quickstart-blockchain-as-a-new-workspace) if you've already created a Quickstart workspace and are ready to add Truffle projects or make customizations.
* If you're starting fresh chec k out [Creating a Workspace from Scratch](#creating-a-workspace-from-scratch).

## Saving the Current Quickstart Blockchain as a New Workspace

As mentioned above, the `Quickstart` workspace resets the blockchain on every restart. Perhaps we found ourselves prototyping in the `Quickstart` workspace to try out a couple of things, but then we want to save the blockchain as a new workspace for later recall.

To accomplish this, click the `SAVE` button near the upper right of the screen when in the `Quickstart` workspace. You will be taken to the [options screen to configure your workspace](#workspace-configuration).

## Creating a Workspace From Scratch

You can also create a workspace from the home screen. Clicking the `NEW WORKSPACE` button on the home screen will take us to the [options screen to configure your workspace](#workspace-configuration).

## Workspace Configuration

A workspace name will be randomly generated for you, but you can go ahead and change it. You can also change any of the other configuration options. When you're ready to start the new workspace, click `SAVE WORKSPACE` in the top right corner.

You will be taken to the accounts screen. Notice the name of your new workspace near the upper right.
