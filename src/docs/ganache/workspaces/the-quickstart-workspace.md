# The Quickstart Workspace

The `QUICKSTART` button on the home screen opens the `Quickstart` workspace. This workspace is similar to how Ganache 1.x worked: you get a brand new blockchain with a genesis block every time you open it. The `Quickstart` workspace is meant to provide a clean slate for prototype development.
