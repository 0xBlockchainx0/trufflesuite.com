## Plans

When you sign up for Truffle Teams you are automatically enrolled in the free plan. The free plan comes with unlimited builds, monitoring of unlimited contracts, unlimited deployments to testnets, sandboxes, and mainnet, and access to 1 Ganache sandbox.

You can upgrade to pro or enterprise plans at anytime. For a pro plan, you'll get everything that comes with the free plan plus private repositories and access to 3 Ganache sandboxes. <a href="/docs/teams/account/claim-pro-trial">Try out pro for a free month</a>!

To upgrade to a pro plan, click **BILLING > UPGRADE** and you'll be prompted to enter your billing information and payment method. If you're interested in our enterprise plan, <a href="mailto:sales@trufflesuite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="sc-dymIpo jtCNSr sc-ktHwxA isqCSL">contact us</a> to get a tailored experience for you and your team.

If you have subscribed to the pro plan and for any reason would like to switch back to the free plan, click **BILLING** then select the **FREE** plan.
