# Contracts overview

Truffle Teams can monitor any contract that is deployed to a network and has a Truffle artifact file. Monitoring provides realtime data for a deployed contract including: transactions (both successful and failed), events, and the contract's balance. It also displays useful information such as the address and creation transaction hash.

To view your contract information, you must have either created a deployment from within the Truffle Teams interface or have uploaded an external deployment // TODO ADD LINK TO DOCS. Click on **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>**, then select the deployment name you would like to view from the list of all deployments. Now, you will see the deployment details and a list of your contracts will appear under the **CONTRACTS** tab.
