# Debugger overview

Truffle Teams comes with a powerful visual debugger that enables you to replay and systematically step through the transactions made against your project's contracts.

<strong>Note</strong>: The Truffle Teams Debugger is currently available as part of our <code>Early Access</code> program, which when enabled gives you access to cutting-edge and potentially unstable features. It requires opting-in which can be done by clicking Settings | Advanced.
