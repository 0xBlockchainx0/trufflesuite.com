# Debugging a Transaction

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: Truffle Teams currently only allows you to debug transactions on <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview">Ganache sandboxes</a>. Support for public networks (such as the <code>GÃ¶rli</code> testnet or <code>mainnet</code>) will be available soon.
</p>

The debugger is accessed from the DEPLOYMENTS tab. From here, [select the deployment](/docs/teams/deployments/deployment-details) which included the contracts that received the transaction that you are looking to debug. In the example screenshot below, this is `deployment-01`.

</figure>

At this screen, you can either click **<span class="inline-button"><i class="fas fa-heart-rate"></i> MONITOR</span>**  to the right of the contract to view transactions sent solely to that contract address, or the **TRANSACTIONS** tab to view all the transactions associated with the entire deployment.

</figure>

Assuming your contract(s) have received one or more transactions you will now see a list similar to the screenshot below.

The debugger can be started by clicking on the **<span class="inline-button"><i class="fas fa-debug"></i> DEBUG</span>** button located on the right-hand-side of a given transaction.
