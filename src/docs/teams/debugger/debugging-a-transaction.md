# Debugging a transaction

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: Truffle Teams currently only allows you to debug transactions on <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview">Ganache sandboxes</a>. Support for public networks (such as the <code>GÃ¶rli</code> testnet or <code>mainnet</code>) will be available soon.
</p>

The debugger is accessed from the **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>** page. From here, [select the deployment](/docs/teams/deployments/deployment-details) which included the contracts that received the transaction that you are looking to debug. In the example screenshot below, this is `deployment-01`.

  <figcaption class="text-center">The Truffle Teams Deployments screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

At this screen, you can either click **<span class="inline-button"><i class="fas fa-heart-rate"></i> MONITOR</span>** to the right of the contract to view transactions sent solely to that contract address, or the **TRANSACTIONS** tab to view all the transactions associated with the entire deployment.

Assuming your contract(s) have received one or more transactions you will now see a list similar to the screenshot below.

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: The Truffle Teams Debugger is currently only available for transactions excuted sent to contracts in <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview">Ganache sandboxes</a> and accordingly the DEBUG button will show as disabled for other networks. Debugging transactions made against public networks will be available in a forthcoming release.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: The Truffle Teams Debugger is currently available as part of our <code>Early Access</code> program and, as such, the <span class="inline-button"><i class="fas fa-debug"></i> DEBUG</span> button will not be visible until it's enabled. It requires opting-in, as it gives you access to cutting-edge and potentially unstable features, which can be done by clicking Settings > Advanced.
</p>

The debugger can be started by clicking on the **<span class="inline-button"><i class="fas fa-debug"></i> DEBUG</span>** button located on the right-hand-side of a given transaction.
