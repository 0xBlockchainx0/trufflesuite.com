# Archiving a deployment

No longer need a particular deployment? To archive a deployment, go to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>**, and click on the 3 vertical dots of your chosen deployment. Select **ARCHIVE** from the menu to use the same build as the basis of your deployment into Mainnet. Other than selecting a different network in MetaMask, the steps are the same! After you're done, you'll see a new deployment in the production section.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
<strong><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Be careful</strong> when using the archive feature; we haven't implemented a way to unarchive deployments yet.
