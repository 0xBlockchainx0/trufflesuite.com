# Archiving a deployment

No longer need a particular deployment? To archive a deployment, go to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>**.

If you're using the **PIPELINE** view, click on the 3 vertical dots of your chosen deployment, select **ARCHIVE**, and confirm the archival.

If you're using the **TABLE** view, click on the **ACTIONS** dropdown of your chosen deployment, selected **Archive**, and confirm the archival.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Be careful</strong> when using the archive feature; we haven't implemented a way to unarchive deployments yet.
