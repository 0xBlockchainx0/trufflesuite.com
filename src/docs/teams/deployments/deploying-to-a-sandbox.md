# Deploying to a sandbox

To deploy to a sandbox, be sure that you have already created a sandbox, or head to the <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/create-a-sandbox">Create a sandbox</a> section of our documentation for more information. Before you can deploy, you have to connect our sandbox instance to MetaMask. Click **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="far fa-cubes"></i>SANDBOXES</span>** and copy the **RPC URL** of the sandbox you'd like to deploy to. Open MetaMask and save the RPC URL as a **Custom RPC**. Now, your sandbox will appear in the dropdown list of networks to deploy to. Head over to the <a href="/docs/teams/deployments/create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</a> section of our documentation to learn how to deploy. Make sure to select your sandbox instance from the **Network** dropdown when creating your deployment.
