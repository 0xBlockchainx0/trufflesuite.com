# Deployment console

The deployment console is where you can find all of the output from the deployment process. This can be helpful in debugging when a deployment fails or for better understanding of the overall deployment process. To access the deployment console, head to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>**, then click on the deployment name you would like to view. On the deployment details page, you'll be able to select the **CONSOLE** tab to see the deployment output.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note</strong>: You cannot currently view the deployment console for in progress or failed deployments. We're currently working on fixing this.
