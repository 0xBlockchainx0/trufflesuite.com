# Deployment details

From the deployment details page, you can view the associated contracts, addresses, [transactions](/docs/teams/contract-monitoring), and [deployment console output](/docs/teams/deployments/deployment-console).

To view the deployment details page, head to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>** and click on the deployment name you would like to view.

If you're using the **TABLE** view, you can find the deployment name under the **NAME** column.

If you're using the **PIPELINE** view, you can find the deployment name in the **Deployment Details** section of the deployment card:
