# Sandboxes overview

Sandboxes are shared Ganache instances you can create with the click of a button. Convenient features of Ganache's local development experience are now available to the whole team! Each sandbox has 10 pre-funded accounts and near-instant transaction times giving your team a performant, turnkey blockchain environment without spending a single wei on transactions.

Currently, sandboxes exist in isolation of the other features of Truffle Teams. Our next iteration will allow you to target a sandbox on the Deployments screen, as well as integrate with Monitoring. Sandboxes in Truffle Teams will also be the easiest way to use live chain data in your environment via forking.
