        <h1 class="mb-4">LOCATION</h1>
        <p>TruffleCon 2018 will be at the <a href="http://portland.hilton.com/">Hilton Portland Downtown</a> hotel, right in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon. Easily accessible from the airport and steps from many of Portland's most famous landmarks and dozens of food carts, the Hilton provides an excellent backdrop for TruffleCon 2018.</p>
        <p>We have negotiated a special rate for TruffleCon attendees. <strong>Use the Group Code: CON</strong> (not Promotion/Offer Code!) <strong>when booking to receive your special rate.</strong> These rooms are limited, so please don't delay. <strong>You must book by September 6, 2018.</strong></p>
        <p>(Workshops on October 5 will be at a different location, with details coming soon.)</p>

        <h1 class="mb-4">FAQ</h1>
        <ul class="faq">
          <li>Who is TruffleCon for?</li>
          <li>TruffleCon is a software developer-focused conference, with a focus on the Truffle suite of tools. So if you are familiar with Ethereum development, you would be a good fit for the conference. You don't need to be an expert though; we welcome all experience levels!</li>
          
          <li>Who is TruffleCon not for?</li>
          <li>Since this is a software conference, the focus is not on cryptocurrency, token sales, or other financial transactions. There are plenty of other conferences for this type of content though, and we wish you the best of luck.</li>
          
          <li>Does buying an "Early bird" or "Regular" ticket get me access to the workshops?</li>
          <li>No, the workshops are an add-on ticket, separated out for capacity reasons. Please select "Workshops add-on" during the checkout process.</li>
          
          <li>What if I don't know if I want to attend the workshops?</li>
          <li>No problem, you can purchase your standard entry ticket now, and purchase the "Workshop add-on" ticket at a later date.</li>
          
          <li>Can I attend the workshops but not the larger conference?</li>
          <li>You can, but you still need to purchase a full conference ticket as well as the "Workshop add-on" ticket. (But we do hope you'll stick around!)</li>
          
          <li>Will lunch be served?</li>
          <li>Portland has an extensive <a href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/">food cart landscape</a>, with dozens of carts available in walking distance. While we will have coffee and snacks throughout the day, and the Hilton contains a cafe and a restaurant, attendees should expect to take care of their own meals. (But feel free to go out with people you've met at the conference.)</li>
          
          <li>Where should I stay in Portland?</li>
          <li>We hope you'll stay onsite at the <a href="http://portland.hilton.com/">Hilton Portland Downtown</a>. Not only is the site right downtown, convenient to everything, but we've negotiated a special rate for TruffleCon attendees.</li>
          
          <li>Should I book my hotel now?</li>
          <li>Yes! We have negotiated a special rate with the Hilton for TruffleCon attendees. <strong>Use the Group Code: CON</strong> (not Promotion/Offer Code!) <strong>when booking to receive your special rate.</strong> These rooms are limited, so please don't delay. <strong>You must book by September 6, 2018.</strong></li>
          
          <li>Should I rent a car when I get to Portland?</li>
          <li>No need. Portland has excellent public transportation, and downtown parking is expensive and incnvenient. You can ride the MAX Red Line train from Portland International Airport (PDX) to within three blocks of the hotel venue. We encourage everyone to utilize public transportation. Please see trimet.org for information on how to get around.</li>
          
          <li>Is Portlandia, the TV show, anything like Portland the city?</li>
          <li>You'll have to show up and see for yourself.</li>
          
          <li>Where do I get a question answered that's not answered here?</li>
          <li>You can email us at <a href="mailto:trufflecon@trufflesuite.com">trufflecon@trufflesuite.com</a>, or tweet at us at <a href="https://twitter.com/trufflesuite">@truffesuite</a>.</li>
